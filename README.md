## 💼 About Me  
I work as a project manager at a large company:  
📃 handling contracts,  
📦 organizing purchases,  
🛠️ coordinating field operations.  

I love structure, efficiency, and clear results. Lately, I’ve been diving into the world of crypto and Web3 — exploring DeFi, testing airdrops, posting casts, playing Farcaster games, and trying out new protocols.
